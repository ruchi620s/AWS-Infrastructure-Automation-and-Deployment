🖥️ Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Definition:
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a core AWS (Amazon Web Services) service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. In simple terms, it lets you run virtual servers — called EC2 instances — to host applications, websites, or workloads without managing physical hardware.

🚀 Key Features

Scalability:
Quickly increase or decrease the number or size of instances based on demand.

Pay-as-you-go:
You pay only for the compute time you use — no upfront costs.

Multiple Instance Types:
Choose from general-purpose, compute-optimised, memory-optimised, or GPU instances depending on your workload.

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability.

Auto Scaling:
Automatically adjusts the number of instances to handle traffic changes.

Security:
Integrated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Security Groups, and VPC for controlled access.

🧩 Common Use Cases

Hosting web applications or APIs

Running backend services or microservices

Machine learning model training/inference

Batch processing or data analysis

Development and test environments

💡 Example

Let’s say you want to host a website:

You launch an EC2 instance (a virtual server).

Install Apache or Nginx on it.

Deploy the website’s code.

Attach an Elastic IP and security group.

The website is now accessible on the internet!
