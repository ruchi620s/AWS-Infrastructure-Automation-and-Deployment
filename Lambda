⚙️ What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
You just upload your function code, and AWS takes care of scaling, availability, and infrastructure automatically.

Lambda runs your code only when triggered, and you pay only for the compute time your code uses — no charge when it’s idle.

💡 How It Works

Write your code (in Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, etc.).

Upload it to AWS Lambda.

Set a trigger — for example:


An API call (via API Gateway)

A file upload in S3

A message from SNS/SQS

A schedule (using CloudWatch Events)

Lambda automatically runs your code and scales based on the number of incoming requests.

🔄 Example Scenario

Use Case: Automatically process uploaded images.

A user uploads an image to Amazon S3.

This event triggers a Lambda function.

The Lambda function runs Python code that:

Resizes the image,

Stores the resized image in another S3 bucket,

Updates a database or sends a notification.

No servers, no manual scaling — just event-driven automation. ✅

🧩 Key Features
Feature	Description
Serverless: No servers to manage — AWS handles all infrastructure.
Event-Driven: Automatically runs in response to events (S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.).
Auto Scaling	Scales automatically with the number of events.
Multi-language Support: Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, C#, PowerShell.
Pay-per-Use	Billed by execution time (per ms) and number of requests.
Integrated with AWS Services,works seamlessly with S3, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudWatch, etc.
💰 Pricing

You pay for:

Number of requests (free up to 1 million/month)

Execution duration (charged per GB-second of compute time)

🧠 Common Use Cases

Serverless APIs using API Gateway + Lambda

Real-time file processing (S3 trigger)

Automation scripts and cron jobs

Event-driven workflows

Chatbots and backend microservices

📝 Simple Python Example
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    name = event.get('name', 'World')
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f'Hello, {name}!'
    }


If you invoke this Lambda function with the input:

{ "name": "Ruchi" }


It returns:

{ "statusCode": 200, "body": "Hello, Ruchi!" }
